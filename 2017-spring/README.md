## Description

> Founded in 1919 as a course on War and Peace Issues, the central purpose of
> Contemporary Civilization is to introduce students to a range of issues
> concerning the kinds of communities – political, social, moral, and
> religious – that human beings construct for themselves and the values that
> inform and define such communities; the course is intended to prepare
> students to become active and informed citizens. While readings in this
> one-year course change from time to time, the factors that lead to adoption
> of a text always include historical influence, the presentation of ideas of
> enduring importance, and the demonstrated ability of a text to provoke
> productive discussion.

## Assessment

We want to build a community of readers and thinkers in this class---who are
able to work collectively and collaboratively. setting my assessment
goals on two paths: firstly, I want to make sure we are doing close-reading of
the texts, and secondly, I want to ensure that we are critical and engaged
writers. With those goals, I ask that you do two forms of regular writing in
the class - short form discussion and research oriented.

* 15 points for Presentation on Text/Author: Every class, one student will
deliver a short-presentation (~10 mins) on the Text/Author we are reading.
The presentation will highlight their biography, their intellectual concerns
and contributions, and some recent assessment of their thought in scholarly
literature (JSTOR searches limited to past 5 years). This presentation will
be posted on Piazza before the class begins. 
 
* 25 points for Presentations on Context/Time: Every class, one student will
deliver a short-presentation (~10 mins) on the context for the Text/Author we
are reading. This context will comprise of at least ten (10) headlines
selected from newspapers contemporary to the Text/Author. To assemble these
headlines, you will visit the Subject Specialists at Butler Library
<http://library.columbia.edu/about/policies/collection-development/liaisons.html>,
who can assist you in identifying the appropriate digitized archives of
contemporary newspapers. This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the
class begins.


30 points for Discussion on Piazza: Each class, After the class, I ask that
you respond to either the Text/Author or Context/Time posts of your
colleagues, or the discussion as it unfolded in the class, or to a theme
within the work. I ask that you keep your discussions under the posts of your
colleague. I will assess them individually (as posts) as well as collectively
(as a debate). You may begin a new post if 1) You are making a critical
intervention in the debate - a significant aspect of the discussion that you
feel needs our collective attention or 2) You are returning to the Text/Author
and launching a new facet of discussion that is important and is not being
discussed. I expect the ideal responses to incorporate textual citation
(quote/reference), to propel the argument forward, to engage fully with the
intellectual content of the essay, or the previous comments. However, I expect
all posts to incorporate awareness of manners of being, modes of address,
intellectual honesty and empathy towards your colleagues. You should aim to
average a post per class over the semester.

20 points for two papers: A week after your presentation on Text/Author or
Context/Time, you will submit a written paper (approx 500 words) on your
research. For the Text/Author, you will critically discuss the contemporary
debates on the subject that you un-covered in your examination of JSTOR. For
the Context/Time, you will do a reading of the headlines you researched. These
short assignments are opportunities for you to present the work you have done
and to incorporate as well the discussion with your colleagues in the class
and outside of the class.

10 points for Participation: To get the full points, you will attend every
single class, and be an active listener to your colleagues, and sometimes, a
commenter and facilitator for their ideas and sometimes, a speaker of your own
thoughts.

## Policies

Attendance and participation is required. Class participation requires your
active participation. Some basic rules: come to class on time, do not disrupt
the class, put your phones on silent, turn off all computing devices. As a
discussion seminar, this course survives only if you come to every class, and
participate by doing the readings, listening and commenting in class, turning
in the assignment and seeing me during my office hours. Discussion means
attentive and respectful listening, short and timely speaking, and creating a
cordial and warm atmosphere wherein all are invited to test their ideas and
impressions. Please read everything before class. Take notes in the margins of
the text; underline key sentences and paragraphs, annotate; write out what
feels extraordinary, questionable, pleasant, or remarkable (and remark it out
loud in class).

## Please Note the Core Policy on Student Attendance:

“Students are expected to attend every session of their Core classes. Students
who miss class without instructor permission should expect to have their grade
lowered. Repeated unexcused absences will result in a failing grade or a
withdrawal from the class. In the event that a student must miss a class due
to religious observance, illness, or family emergency, instructors may
strongly encourage (though not require) that students complete additional
assignments to help make up for lost class participation. Whenever possible
(in the case of religious holidays, for example), students should provide
advance notification of absence.

## Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty Policy:

Columbia College is dedicated to the highest ideals of integrity in academia.
Therefore, in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, any
instance of academic dishonesty, attempted or actual, will be reported to the
faculty chair of the course and to the dean of the Core Curriculum, who will
review the case with the expectation that a student guilty of academic
dishonesty will receive the grade of “F” in the course and be referred to
dean’s discipline for further institutional action.
