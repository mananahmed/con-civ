## Enlightenment: Reason, Humanism, Violence

> Founded in 1919 as a course on War and Peace Issues, the central purpose of
> Contemporary Civilization is to introduce students to a range of issues
> concerning the kinds of communities – political, social, moral, and
> religious – that human beings construct for themselves and the values that
> inform and define such communities; the course is intended to prepare
> students to become active and informed citizens. While readings in this
> one-year course change from time to time, the factors that lead to adoption
> of a text always include historical influence, the presentation of ideas of
> enduring importance, and the demonstrated ability of a text to provoke
> productive discussion.

In the second semester of our course we will explore the rise and the legacy
of Enlightenment thought, where sustained violence and colonial expansion
undermines the promise of rational, scientific basis for the human condition.

## Assessment

The class depends on an engaged readership. To this end, students are expected
read regularly, discuss the texts in class and online, complete a single "core
context" assignment along with a final exam.

* 25% Core Context
* 25% Connected Core
* 25% Class Participation
* 25% Final Exam

## Core Context

Every class, one student will deliver a short-presentation (~10 mins) on the
Text/Author we are reading. The presentation will highlight their biography,
their intellectual concerns and contributions, and some recent assessment of
their thought in scholarly literature (JSTOR searches limited to past 5
years). This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the class begins.

Another student will deliver a short-presentation (~10 mins) on the context
for the Text/Author we are reading. This context will comprise of at least ten
(10) headlines selected from newspapers contemporary to the Text/Author. To
assemble these headlines, you will visit the Subject Specialists at Butler
Library
<http://library.columbia.edu/about/policies/collection-development/liaisons.html>,
who can assist you in identifying the appropriate digitized archives of
contemporary newspapers. This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the
class begins.

## Connected Core (Online Forum)

https://piazza.com/class/iy1tkxzviyq7fe

As part of an experiment to foster a conversation across the Core, our online
class discussion will take place in conjunction with Professor Manan Ahmed's
CC1102-4 section. Nikhil Ramachandran (nr2600) will moderate the forums. We
will have the opportunity to meet in person in several "town-hall" style
meetings throughout the semester.

Every week (by Wednesday midnight at the latest) we ask that you write a short
response to the readings ahead, comment on the class proceedings, and engage
with your peers. A good post will contain a reference to specific passages, a
specific thought or question, or a meaningful contribution to an ongoing
discussion.

You should aim to average a post per class over the semester and more if you
tend to be quiet in class.

You may begin a new post if 1) You are making a critical intervention in the
debate---a significant aspect of the discussion that you feel needs our
collective attention or 2) You are returning to the Text/Author and launching
a new facet of discussion that is important and is not being discussed. 

## Class Participation

To get the full points, you will attend every single class, and be an active
listener to your colleagues, and sometimes, a commenter and facilitator for
their ideas and sometimes, a speaker of your own thoughts.

We expect our discussions--online and in-person--to answer to the ideals
embodied in our texts. We aim for a critical discussion, one that at the same
time preserves the multiplicity of voices present in the classroom. Listen as
much as you speak, be respectful of dissenting voices, enter into a dialogue
rather than a soliloquy, show empathy, respond, and encourage others to speak.

## Policies

Attendance and participation is required. Class participation requires your
active participation. Some basic rules: come to class on time, do not disrupt
the class, put your phones on silent, turn off all computing devices. As a
discussion seminar, this course survives only if you come to every class, and
participate by doing the readings, listening and commenting in class, turning
in the assignment and seeing me during my office hours. Discussion means
attentive and respectful listening, short and timely speaking, and creating a
cordial and warm atmosphere wherein all are invited to test their ideas and
impressions. Please read everything before class. Take notes in the margins of
the text; underline key sentences and paragraphs, annotate; write out what
feels extraordinary, questionable, pleasant, or remarkable (and remark it out
loud in class).

### Core Policy on Student Attendance

“Students are expected to attend every session of their Core classes. Students
who miss class without instructor permission should expect to have their grade
lowered. Repeated unexcused absences will result in a failing grade or a
withdrawal from the class. In the event that a student must miss a class due
to religious observance, illness, or family emergency, instructors may
strongly encourage (though not require) that students complete additional
assignments to help make up for lost class participation. Whenever possible
(in the case of religious holidays, for example), students should provide
advance notification of absence.

### Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty Policy

 Columbia College is dedicated to the highest ideals of integrity in academia.
Therefore, in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, any
instance of academic dishonesty, attempted or actual, will be reported to the
faculty chair of the course and to the dean of the Core Curriculum, who will
review the case with the expectation that a student guilty of academic
dishonesty will receive the grade of “F” in the course and be referred to
dean’s discipline for further institutional action.
